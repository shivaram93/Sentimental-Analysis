// the dataset is taken from online resources
1. Implemented POS tagging, Stop words using NLTK. 

2. Features are stored seperately.

3. Also Implemented Naive Bayes and SVM using nltk package by pre-processing the dataset.

Proposed:

4. Created a class clalled Voting classifier and inherit all the existing classifiers and also add few more classifiers using SCI-KIT learn package.

5. Calculate the mode and assign majority votes based on the predicted probabilities of all the combined classifiers.


6. Return the mode value which is greater.


7. Finding the confidence levels for the classifiers. we have algorithms voting. Tally the votes for and against the winning vote, and call this "confidence". 

For example, 3/5 votes for positive is weaker than 5/5 votes. we can literally return the ratio of votes as a sort of confidence indicator.

8. Find the accuracy (backend actually it works based on finding all true positive,true negative,false positive,false negative. (Inbuilt function)


9. Plot the accuracy to compare with exisiting and proposed.


10. Create a user interface to check for sentiment review using test data.
